## My process

It was a little bit difficult at the beggining because i struggled with fitting the image inside the container but after some research on the internet and a few questions to chatgpt i managed to recreate the design as best as I could.
After I finished the design I started working at the media query which I am not 100% satisfied with because I think that the image is too big but I plan to fix that in the future

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox



### Continued development

I plan to improve the media query part in the future.

### Useful resources

- ChatGPT was a great resource for me.
- freecodecamp.org/news/media-query-css-example-max-and-min-screen-width-for-mobile-responsive-design/ also helped me understand the media query better.
